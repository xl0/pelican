We have curated, dehydrated documentation in lovely-docs/

WORKFLOW:
1. At the START of EVERY session, run: list_dir on /home/xl0/work/projects/pelican/lovely-docs
2. Check the LLM_TREE.md for each relevant library BEFORE using it. Make a mental note on new features that you might not know about.
3. If documentation exists for a library you're about to use, read the relevant sections before using a feature for the first time.
